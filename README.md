# AirQuality - Abstract

As awareness regarding pollution of the environment is raised, a growing demand for an inexpensive and easy-to-build system to monitor the air quality and pollution levels has appeared from citizens of Canterbury themselves.
    Citizens are willing to gather evidence of pollution, to present it to their local decision-making organisation, for instance to the city council, or any other regional political entities.
    Air pollution in modern cities of Southern England is mostly caused by diesel engines, rejecting nitrogen dioxide (NO2). By coupling an NO2 sensor with a GPS module on a microcontroller, a map of the air quality levels could be established by uploading the sensor location and data measured.
    The result of this project is a DIY tutorial, explaining and guiding the user to build such a device by themselves. The code written to run the device developed during this project is also made available for download and modification, so that the users can either use it as-is, or adapt it to their setup if they use different hardware components.
